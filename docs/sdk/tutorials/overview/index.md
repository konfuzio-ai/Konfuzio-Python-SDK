## Overview

The first step we're going to cover is :ref:`Categorization<document-categorization-tutorials>`, where a Document is 
labelled to be of a certain Category within the Project.

Second part is on :ref:`File Splitting<file-splitting-tutorials>`
â€“ this happens when the original Document consists of several smaller sub-Documents and needs to be separated so that 
each one can be processed individually.

Third part describes :ref:`Information Extraction<information-extraction-tutorials>`, during which various 
information is obtained from unstructured texts, 
i.e. Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels.

For a more in-depth look at each step, be sure to check out the :ref:`Architecture Diagram<architecture-sdk-to-server>` 
that reflects each step of the document-processing pipeline.
