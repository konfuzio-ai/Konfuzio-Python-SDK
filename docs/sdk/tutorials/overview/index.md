## Overview

In this section you can find various tutorials on document-related AI processes in detail. These processes allow to 
split stack scans, categorize and extract information from the Documents.

The first step we're going to cover is :ref:`Categorization<document-categorization-tutorials>`, where a Document is 
labelled to be of a certain Category within the Project.

The second section is on :ref:`File Splitting<file-splitting-tutorials>`
â€“ this happens when the original Document consists of several smaller sub-Documents and needs to be separated so that 
each one can be processed individually.

The third section will go over the various options for :ref:`Document Tokenization<tokenization-tutorials>`.

The fourth part describes :ref:`Information Extraction<information-extraction-tutorials>`, during which various 
information is obtained and labeled from unstructured texts, i.e. Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels.

For a more in-depth look at each step, be sure to check out the :ref:`Architecture Diagram<architecture-sdk-to-server>` 
that reflects each step of the document-processing pipeline.
