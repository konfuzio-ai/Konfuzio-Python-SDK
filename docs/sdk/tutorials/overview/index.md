## Overview

The first step we're going to cover is [Categorization](tutorials/document_categorization/index.html), where a Document is 
labelled to be of a certain Category within the Project.

Second part is on [File Splitting](tutorials/file_splitting/index.html)
â€“ this happens when the original Document consists of several smaller sub-Documents and needs to be separated so that 
each one can be processed individually.

Third part describes [Information Extraction](tutorials/information_extraction/index.html), during which various 
information is obtained from unstructured texts, 
i.e. Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels.

For a more in-depth look at each step, be sure to check out the 
[Architecture Diagram](explanations.html#architecture-sdk-to-server) that reflects each step of the 
document-processing pipeline.
