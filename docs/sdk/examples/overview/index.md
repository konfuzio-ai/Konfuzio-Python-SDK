## Overview

The first step we're going to cover is [File Splitting](tutorials.html#id1) 
â€“ this happens when the original Document consists of several smaller sub-Documents and needs to be separated so that each one can be processed individually.

Second part is on [Categorization](tutorials.html#document-categorization), where a Document is labelled to be of a certain Category within the Project. 

Third part describes [Information Extraction](tutorials.html#document-information-extraction), during which various information is obtained from unstructured texts, 
i.e. Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels.

For a more in-depth look at each step, be sure to check out the 
[Architecture Diagram](explanations.html#architecture-sdk-to-server) that reflects each step of the 
document-processing pipeline.
