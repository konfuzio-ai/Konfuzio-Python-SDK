## Overview

In this section you can find various tutorials on document-related AI processes in detail. These processes allow to 
split stack scans, categorize and extract information from the Documents.

The first step we're going to cover is [File Splitting](tutorials.html#file-splitting-tutorials)
– this happens when the original Document consists of several smaller sub-Documents and needs to be separated so that each one can be processed individually.

Second part is on [Categorization](tutorials.html#document-categorization), where a Document is labelled to be of a certain Category within the Project. 

Third part describes [Information Extraction](tutorials.html#document-information-extraction), during which various information is obtained from unstructured texts, 
i.e. Name, Date, Recipient, or any other custom Labels.

For a more in-depth look at each step, be sure to check out the 
[Architecture Diagram](explanations.html#architecture-sdk-to-server) that reflects each step of the 
document-processing pipeline.

Further in this section you can find tutorials on various ways you can use the SDK – for instance, [how to get the Regex-based 
Annotations](tutorials.html#create-regex-based-annotations) or [how to visualize the word-level Bounding boxes of a Document](tutorials.html#getting-word-bounding-box-bbox-for-a-document).
