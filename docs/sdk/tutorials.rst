Train a Konfuzio SDK Model to Extract Information From Payslip Documents
-----------------------------------------------------------

The tutorial *RFExtractionAI Demo* aims to show you how to use the Konfuzio SDK package to use a simple `Whitespace
tokenizer <https://dev.konfuzio.com/sdk/sourcecode.html#konfuzio_sdk.tokenizer.regex.WhitespaceTokenizer>`_ and to
train a "RFExtractionAI" model to find and extract relevant information like Name, Date and Recipient
from payslip documents.

You can |OpenInColab|_ or download it from `here <https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/document-ai-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/sdk/examples/RFExtractionAI%20Demo.ipynb>`_
and try it by yourself.

Retrain Flair NER-Ontonotes-Fast with Human Revised Annotations
---------------------------------------------------------------

The tutorial *HRetrain Flair NER-Ontonotes-Fast with Human Revised Annotations* aims to show you how to use the
Konfuzio SDK package to include an easy feedback workflow in your training pipeline. It also gives an example of how you
can take advantage of open-source models to speed up the annotation process and use the feedback workflow to adapt the
domain knowledge of the model to your aim.

You can |OpenInColab1|_ or download it from
`here <https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/document-ai-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/sdk/examples/human_in_the_loop.ipynb>`_
and try it by yourself.

Count Relevant Expressions in Annual Reports
--------------------------------------------

The tutorial *Count Relevant Expressions in Annual Reports* aims to show you how to use the Konfuzio SDK package to
retrieve structured and organized information that can be used for a deeper analysis and understanding of your data.
It will show you how to identify and count pre-specified expressions in documents and how to collect that information.

You can |OpenInColab2|_ or download it from
`here <https://github.com/konfuzio-ai/document-ai-python-sdk/blob/master/docs/sdk/examples/word_count.ipynb>`_
and try it by yourself.
