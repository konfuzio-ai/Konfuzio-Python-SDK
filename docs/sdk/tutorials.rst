7. :doc:`Create your own File Splitting AI <tutorials/create-custom-splitting-ai/index>`

Build a custom File Splitting AI and define your own architecture or reuse any external model. This tutorial provides
guidance about constructing a class for the model for File Splitting that can later be reused on Konfuzio app
or in an on-prem installation.

8. :doc:`Evaluate the performance of a File Splitting AI <tutorials/file-splitting-evaluation/index>`

Get to know how to work with FileSplittingEvaluation class, assess the performance of Splitting AIs and interpret the
results.

9. :doc:`Tokenization <tutorials/tokenizers/index>`

Delve into the world of document tokenization, a crucial step in text analysis. This tutorial explores various tokenization techniques and their applications.

10. :doc:`Information Extraction <tutorials/information_extraction/index>`

Unlock the potential of extracting valuable information from unstructured text. This tutorial guides you through the process of identifying and labeling key details.

11. :doc:`Upload your AI model to use on Konfuzio app or an on-prem installation <tutorials/upload-your-ai/index>`
